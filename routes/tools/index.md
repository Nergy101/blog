# Tools & Utilities

A collection of useful tools and utilities I use for managing my infrastructure and services. All of these are self-hosted solutions that give you complete control over your data and services.

## Available Tools

{{routes:toc}}

## Why Self-Hosted?

I prefer self-hosted solutions for several reasons:

- **Data Control**: Complete ownership and control over your data
- **Privacy**: No third-party tracking or data collection
- **Customization**: Full control over features and configuration
- **Cost**: Often more cost-effective for high usage
- **Learning**: Great way to learn about infrastructure and DevOps

## Infrastructure Stack

These tools work together to provide a complete self-hosted infrastructure:

- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: Reverse proxy and SSL certificate management
- **Kuma**: Uptime monitoring and status pages
- **Umami**: Privacy-focused web analytics

## Getting Started

Each tool includes detailed installation and configuration instructions. Most can be deployed using Docker Compose for easy setup and management.

_All tools are actively maintained and used in production environments._
