## About My Projects

I love building things and learning new technologies. My projects range from:

- **Web Applications**: Full-stack applications built with modern frameworks
- **CLI Tools**: Developer productivity tools and utilities
- **Libraries & Packages**: Open-source contributions and personal libraries
- **Experiments**: Proof-of-concepts and learning projects
